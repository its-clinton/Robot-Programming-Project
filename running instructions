1. Source the bashrc:

	source ~/.bashrc
	
	
To buid:

	cd ~/catkin_ws
	catkin_make
	source devel/setup.bash

2. Start roscore:

Before running any other nodes, you must start the ROS master using roscore. Open a new terminal window and run:


	roscore


3. Run the talker:

After starting roscore, in a separate terminal (not the same one where roscore is running), run your talker node:


	rosrun option3_package talker


4. Run the listener:


In a separate terminal (not the same one where roscore and talker are running), run your listener node:

	rosrun option3_package listener
	

5. Run the launch file to start all five nodes:
	
	roslaunch option3_package five_nodes.launch

    Open two terminals:

    	Terminal 1: Run the Service Server (server.cpp):
        
   		rosrun option3_package service_server

	Terminal 2: Run the Service Client (client.cpp):
	
		rosrun option3_package service_client
